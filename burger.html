    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious Egemen Burger made with love and passion</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>6 slices bacon, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 large onion</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 Â½ teaspoons rum</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>6 large doughnut (4" dia)s cake doughnuts, halved</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
      occasionally, until dry and crispy, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper
      towels. Remove most of the bacon grease from the skillet.Cut onion into 6
      slices. Cook in the remaining bacon grease over medium heat until golden
      brown, 6 to 8 minutes, flipping halfway through. Remove from the heat.
      While the onion is cooking, season beef with salt and pepper. Mix to
      combine and divide into 6 equal portions. Form into meatballs, then use a
      spatula or patty mold to shape meatballs into patties. Heat oil in a large
      skillet over medium heat. While the oil is heating, mix eggs and rum
      together in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper, if desired. Dip
      patties into the egg mixture and place directly in the hot oil. Fry
      patties until cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read
      thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F
      (71 degrees C). Drain patties on paper towels. Compile burgers on doughnut
      halves with bacon and onions.
